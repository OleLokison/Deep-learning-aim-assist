To the project look into the  PowerPoint
----------------------------------------

To make K14-2021... work:

*You need tensorflow-gpu for python 3 and all the libraries you find in the Application Head.
*Optional but i would suggest to use jupyter notebook.
*Adjust the Paths for "SaveModel" and "Template_dir".
*Model is trained for Rainbow six siege.
*If you dont use a 2560x1440 screen you  have to adjust the Screenshot area in the Screenshot function.

Tips:

*If you get a "failed to convolute..." error, most likely you free RAM is too low.
*There is a bunch of other files I made while I was working on this, they are not sorted or jovial. 
 You can find them in the "Other" folder.
