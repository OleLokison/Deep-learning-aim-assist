**The file to run is named K14! To make K14-2021... work:**

*You need tensorflow-gpu for python 3 and all the libraries you find in the Application Head.

*Optional but i would suggest to use jupyter notebook.

*Adjust the Paths for "SaveModel" and "Template_dir".

*Model is trained for Rainbow six siege.

*If you dont use a 2560x1440 screen you  have to adjust the Screenshot area in the Screenshot function.

**Tipps:**

*If you get a "failed to convolute..." error, most likely your not having enough free RAM.

*There is a bunch of other files I made while I was working on this, they are not sorted or jovial. 
 You can find them in the "Other" folder.
